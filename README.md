## What is Zenless Zone Zero?

Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) is a video game from the company Hoyoverse. Is an action RPG with a Hack'n Slash combat system. 
Players must traverse through different challenges assembling a team of 3 characters - called Agents - plus a helper robot called bangboo. 
ZZZ uses a gatcha system to collect agents and bangboos, weapons (w-engines) and gear for characters - called discs.

## What it means to 'build' a team?

ZZZ leveling system is incredibly flexible and sophisticated, inviting players to try and experiment with different builds all the time. 
Players are constantly searching and sharing guides with recommended builds for each character. 
Although useful, these guides are usually biased towards the preferences of the creator, and general trends. 
This leads to a phenomenon called "The Meta", where a subset of agents and builds become the de-facto or 'optimal', where the majority of players gravitates towards. 
The Meta can make new and casual players feel 'left out' because they don't have those builds, and discourages the experimentation aspect of the game.
